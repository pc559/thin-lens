# thin-lens

Code thrown together for a Cambridge open day, to demonstrate how images
of objects in space (such as galaxies) can be lensed by the gravity
of intervening mass.

Main file is "webcam_lensed.py", it lenses the image coming from a webcam.
The keys l,g,c all toggle different features.

"webcam_lensed.py" should take either "lens_mapping_1000_many_lenses.npy"
or "lens_mapping_480.npy" as a command line argument.
